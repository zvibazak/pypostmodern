# pypostmodern
Prepare your Python code to the **postmodernism era**!

>Postmodernist philosophers in general argue that truth is always contingent on historical and social context rather than being absolute and universal and that **truth is always partial and "at issue" rather than being complete and certain**. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism)

So let's turn your Python to **a Postmodern Python, where there is no truth...**
## Example
Running this code with `pypostmodern`:
```python
if False:
    print('It's the postmodernism era!')
```
the output will be:

`It's the postmodernism time!`

## Usage
Clone code with:
`git clone https://github.com/zvibazak/pypostmodern.git`

Edit you code on `script.py`, your code should start with `# coding: my_truth`

Set your truths at `run.py`:
```py
truths = ["1+1==3","False"] #add here more truths... 
```

Run `run.py`
